**A stealth headless browser engine in Rust. Passes Cloudflare without Chromium.**

Real V8 and a DOM, a Chrome TLS/HTTP fingerprint (JA3/JA4) and JS-level stealth,
driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol: Puppeteer and Playwright connect as usual.
Also an MCP server for AI agents.

## Install

```bash
pip install nokk                    # Python: the prebuilt binary is in the wheel
npm install @koloss777/nokk         # Node: run it with `npx nokk`
docker run --rm -p 9222:9222 ghcr.io/koloss777/nokk:latest
```

No browser to download. Prebuilt for Linux (x86_64, ARM64), macOS on Apple Silicon and
Windows x64; anything else [builds from source](docs/BUILD.md).

## Quick start

```bash
# Load a page behind Cloudflare, clear the challenge, print what is behind it
nokk --load https://www.scrapingcourse.com/cloudflare-challenge --solve-challenge 30 \
     --eval "document.querySelector('h2').textContent.trim()"

# Or run the CDP server and drive it from any client
nokk --port 9222 --auto-solve   # ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/nokk
```

```python
import nokk
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with nokk.launch(auto_solve=True) as server, sync_playwright() as pw:
    page = pw.chromium.connect_over_cdp(server.ws_endpoint).new_page()
    page.goto("https://www.scrapingcourse.com/cloudflare-challenge")
    print(page.title())
```

For AI agents, `pip install "nokk[mcp]"` turns it into an [MCP server](#for-ai-agents-mcp).
Puppeteer, Node, sessions and the Cloudflare options are [below](#usage).

## Why nokk

Puppeteer and Playwright drive a real Chromium, and anti-bot systems spot it through
`navigator.webdriver`, CDP artifacts and a headless TLS handshake. nokk is built to
look like Chrome from the TLS handshake to the JavaScript environment, and has no
rendering engine at all.

| | nokk 0.1.35 | Chrome 151 (Puppeteer / Playwright) |
|---|---|---|
| Start until CDP answers | ~0.05 s | ~0.2 s |
| Idle memory (PSS) | ~60 MB, 1 process | ~330 MB, 12–14 processes |
| Cloudflare solve, median wall time | 12.4 s | 12.4 s |
| Slowest solve | 15.6 s | 27.8 s |
| CPU per solve | 6.4 s | 9.5 s |
| Peak memory per solve | ~570 MB | ~720 MB |
| Solved | 24/24 | 24/24 |
| TLS fingerprint (JA3/JA4) | matches Chrome 151 | Chrome |
| Screenshots, PDF, layout | no | yes |
| CDP coverage | the common path | full |

<sub>An 8-core Linux box, October 2026. Cloudflare row: 8 production sites × 3 runs
through one proxy, nokk with <code>--until-clearance</code>, Chrome driven by a
checkbox-clicking harness; a solve counts only if the site then opens with the cookie.</sub>

**Not for you if** you need screenshots, PDFs, layout or paint, or the whole
Playwright/CDP surface: nokk has no rendering engine by design, and its CDP coverage
is the path Puppeteer and Playwright use for navigation and scripting.

## Measured on public pages

Three runs per page from the CLI with `--solve-challenge 30` and no proxy, on an 8-core
Linux box (October 2026). The time is the whole command, from process start to the printed
result. Run them yourself with `tools/cf-check.sh`.

| Page | Challenge | Solved | Median | Slowest |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `chess.com/login` | invisible Turnstile widget on a live site | 3/3 | 7 s | 9 s |
| `scrapingcourse.com/cloudflare-challenge` | managed interstitial | 3/3 | 5 s | 7 s |
| `peet.ws/turnstile-test/managed.html` | managed widget | 3/3 | 7 s | 8 s |
| `peet.ws/turnstile-test/non-interactive.html` | non-interactive widget | 3/3 | 3 s | 4 s |
| `nopecha.com/demo/cloudflare` | interactive interstitial with a checkbox | 3/3 | 10 s | 11 s |

On production sites behind Cloudflare the result is in the [comparison above](#why-nokk):
8 sites, 24 of 24 solved. Those sites are not named here.

## Usage

### Command line

```bash
nokk --fetch https://tls.browserleaks.com/json                   # Chrome TLS + HTTP/2 fingerprint
nokk --load https://example.com --eval 'document.title'          # run the page, query the DOM
nokk --load https://quotes.toscrape.com --dump-requests          # every request the page makes
nokk --load https://target --proxy socks5://host:1080            # through a proxy
nokk --port 9222 --rotate-fingerprint --geoip-timezone           # CDP server, a machine per context
```

Ad, analytics and tracker requests are dropped by default; `--allow-trackers` loads them.
Anti-bot vendors are never blocked, because they must run to hand out a token.

### Puppeteer

```js
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/nokk',   // nokk --port 9222
});
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
console.log(await page.title());
```

### Node and Python

Both packages carry the prebuilt binary and start the CDP server for you.

```js
const server = await require("@koloss777/nokk").launch({ autoSolve: true });
// server.wsEndpoint -> puppeteer.connect / chromium.connectOverCDP
```

```python
with nokk.launch(auto_solve=True) as server:   # or: await nokk.launch_async()
    ...  # server.ws_endpoint -> connect_over_cdp
```

### crawl4ai and other CDP tools

Anything that drives Chrome over CDP can drive nokk instead. crawl4ai, stopped by
Cloudflare with its own Chromium, gets the page behind it through nokk:
`BrowserConfig(browser_mode="custom", cdp_url=server.ws_endpoint)`. See
[docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md).

### For AI agents (MCP)

With the `nokk[mcp]` extra, nokk runs as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server, so an agent such as Claude Desktop or Claude Code browses through the fingerprinted engine.

```jsonc
// pip install "nokk[mcp]"   (use the python from that environment)
{ "mcpServers": { "nokk": { "command": "python", "args": ["-m", "nokk.mcp", "--rotate-fingerprint"] } } }
```

Tools: `open`, `read_text`, `read_html`, `click`, `fill`, `evaluate`, `links`, `reset`.

### Cloudflare challenges

nokk clears Turnstile by itself: the invisible widget, the managed interstitial and the
interactive *Verify you are human* checkbox. Nothing is configured per site. Where a widget
needs a press, the engine presses it like a person would.

- `--solve-challenge N` sets the time budget, and `--fail-on-challenge` exits `3` if a gate is still up.
- `--until-clearance` stops at a fresh `cf_clearance` and skips the heavy page behind the gate.
- `--auto-solve` does the same for every `page.goto()` over CDP; `Nokk.solveChallenge` does it on demand.
- A `cf_clearance` from a real browser can be imported, because nokk's JA4 matches Chrome 151.

Details, the CDP methods and events: [docs/cloudflare.md](docs/cloudflare.md).

### Persistent sessions

`--session-store ./sessions` saves each named session's cookie jar, `cf_clearance` included,
to disk and reloads it in a new process. Warm a session once and reuse it instead of
solving the challenge on every run. See [docs/sessions.md](docs/sessions.md).

### Rotating fingerprints

`--rotate-fingerprint` gives every browser context its own coherent machine: TLS emulation,
User-Agent, client hints, platform, screen and WebGL all agree. `--geoip-timezone` matches the
timezone and languages to the proxy's exit IP. See [docs/fingerprints.md](docs/fingerprints.md).

## Builds

| Build | What it adds | Where |
|---|---|---|
| light (default) | everything above; canvas and WebGL pixels are synthesised | pip, npm, `ghcr.io/koloss777/nokk:latest`, `nokk-*.tar.gz` |
| render | real canvas 2D and WebGL rasterisation, about 100 MB more at peak | `:render` image, `nokk-render-*.tar.gz`, `--features render,webgl` |

Prebuilt for Linux x86_64 and ARM64, macOS on Apple Silicon and Windows x64; the render build
for Linux x86_64. Docker variants, the archives and building from source are in
[docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## How it works

A Cargo workspace of small crates: a V8 isolate pool, a Chrome-fingerprinted HTTP client on
BoringSSL, an `html5ever` DOM, the stealth layer and a CDP server. Concurrency is one isolate
per thread with many contexts each, all IO runs on `tokio` off the isolate threads, and the
JS fingerprint and the TLS fingerprint always agree. More in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Project status

**Alpha.** The engine is real and end-to-end: V8 executes page JS against a parsed DOM,
the fingerprinted transport clears Cloudflare's TLS/HTTP checks, the engine solves
Turnstile on live sites — invisible, managed and interactive — and Puppeteer and Playwright connect
over CDP to open a page, navigate, and evaluate.

What is **not** done yet, and where the sharp edges are:

- **JS-fingerprint hardening is ongoing.** Much of the hardening is in place — native
  `toString` masking, internals hidden from `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`, `navigator`/`screen`
  as real prototype instances, an IP-coherent timezone, and per-context coherent fingerprint
  rotation, Web Workers, canvas/WebGL/WebGPU/audio with Chrome's pixels and samples,
  Trusted Types and CSP. nokk solves Cloudflare's challenges today, and the comparison
  against Chrome section by section is how the remaining tells get found; it is **not**
  yet a match for a dedicated fingerprinting suite like CreepJS. See the
  [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
- **CDP coverage is the common path**, not the whole protocol. Puppeteer and Playwright
  connect over CDP: navigation, `evaluate`, `$` / `$eval` / `$$eval`, `title()`, `url()`,
  new pages and CDP sessions are tested; less-common domains are not implemented yet.
- **Per-context cookie isolation and per-session persistence** work (each browser context
  gets its own jar; named sessions persist across runs); **per-host / per-proxy / global
  connection limits** are not yet enforced (Phase 7).
- No rendering — screenshots, PDF, and layout/paint are out of scope by design.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the phased plan and the concrete hardening backlog.
